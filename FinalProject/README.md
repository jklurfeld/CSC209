My project is a personal portfolio website for music. There is a home page that just has an image and bio. There is a page for upcoming performances, which lists all of the upcoming performances in ascending order by date. If the performance date has already passed, then it no longer gets displayed on this page. There are also past performances which have individual pages. If a user is logged in, they can leave comments on individual past performances, and if they aren't logged in then they can just view it.

The admin is able to manage users, create new past and upcoming performances, and edit or delete existing past and upcoming performances. The video link for the past performances has to be an iframe, which for youtube videos you can copy the code from when you click share and then embed. The upcoming performance table is in ascending order by date and has a divider between dates that have already passed and therefore performances that no longer get displayed. Currently, the admin is not able to edit the image for an upcoming performance. The admin is able to access all of these features through the admin page, which shows up in the navbar when the admin logs in.

On the settings page, users are able to edit their own username and password (the admin is not able to edit their own username or password so they don't have access to this page). I also implemented some error and success messages for the user.
